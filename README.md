## About:
A machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.


## Motivation/Idea:
This is the first ML model which I created for any problem. I heard a lot  about this competition. This competition is also known as the `Hello World` of Data Science/Machine Learning.

## Approach:
